Personal Portfolio

Just a small snippet of who I am and what I do. Stay kind.

Some new projects/visuals are currently underway.
Page is "under construction", but viewable from here.

Bugs to be fixed:
-Set github links to tech used (i.e. click HTML/CSS link to get to code)
-Some transitional elements to add to external pages to lead back to main page
-Coffee
-Update clock widget and eventually finalize a Java or React Project to upload.
-Make better content. Take time, have fun.
