Good day! Welcome to a little Korean memory game.
Hangul (한굴) is the native language of South Korea.
King Sejong implemented its use in 1443 and this list
is a rough representation of where it stands today.
Much like how we have the alphabet in English, in 
the Korean 'alphabet', characters are called jamo (자모)

This doesn't include every character and combination,
but this game is a good guide to get you started.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal here is fairly simple.
- match Jamo to its pronunciation
- try to memorize and do this without a guide

Here's a couple of tips to help a bit.
- Vowels have red background (10 total)
- Consonants have a blue background (14 total)
- For simplicity, no other characters are used
- Below you can find a vowel/consonant guide to help

Practice makes perfect. Hopefully this will tease the brain.
This is not meant to be easy, but to build associative skills.
Have fun and good luck.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------	

As you play the game, a match should look like this.

ㅏ = a
ㄱ = g/k
ㅋ = k

A little confusing at first, but with practice, it'll
make more sense.

ㄱ ㄴ ㄷ ㄹ ㅁ ㅂ ㅅ ㅇ ㅈ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ are consonants 


ㅏ ㅑ ㅓ ㅕ ㅗ ㅛ ㅜ ㅠ ㅡ ㅣ are vowels.


----------------------
Consonants:
ㄱ sounds like g/k.
ㄴ sounds like n.
ㄷ sounds like d/t.
ㄹ sounds like r/l.
ㅁ sounds like m.
ㅂ sounds like b/p.
ㅅ sounds like s. 
ㅇ sounds like ng. 
ㅈ sounds like j.
ㅊ sounds like ch.
ㅋ sounds like k. 
ㅌ sounds like t.
ㅍ sounds like p.
ㅎ sounds like h.
----------------------
Vowels:
ㅏ sounds like a.
ㅑ sounds like ya.
ㅓ sounds like u.
ㅕ sounds like yu.
ㅗ sounds like o.
ㅛ sounds like yo.
ㅜ sounds like oo.
ㅠ sounds like yoo.
ㅡ sounds like eu.
ㅣ sounds like i. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A couple of things that need to be noted.
- ㅇ sounds like ng, only at the end of a character block.
- Several factors can change the jamo pronuciation.
- In the list, there are some characters with two sounds
	(i.e. ㄱ = g/k). Don't worry too much about it, but it
	is worth looking into if you want to further your
	understanding of the language.  

Interesting facts:
- Korean is written in blocks that take several shapes. 수 사 상 샀 쒺

- Blocks will always start with a consonant. ㅇ is used for words that
	don't start with a consonant. (i.e. milk, 'u-yu' '우유').

- There are many different methods used to romanize (alphabetize) hangul,
	but find a way that works for you.
