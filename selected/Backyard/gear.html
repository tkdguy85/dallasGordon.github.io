                    <h2 class="text">My Quantaray 85-210mm is a great, light weight lens that I commonly use for long-distance landscape shots or tracking birds or planes in action. Purchased for about $80.</h2>

                    <h2 class="text">This Opteka 650-1300mm is very bulky and long, but once setup on a tripod, this has helped me shoot deep sky objects and various planets just as well as my telescopes. Focusing can be a bit challenging, but that's all part of the fun. Purchased around $170.</h2>

                    <h2 class="text">That's my lens lineup. Too be totally honest, none of these are deemed high-end lenses by any means, but for a hobbyist like myself, they get the job done. All together with the camera and tripod, I've accumulated this assortment over the past 7-8 years. Even with all of the accessories and other bits, my camera equipment has still costs me less than $1000 USD.</h2>
